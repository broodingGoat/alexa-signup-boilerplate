    Seems we have an issue. Would you mind starting again

    Good to meet you {{ name }}. Give me a four digit numeric id you want to use. It could be date and month of your birthday. For example you can say lets use 0202

    You are all set {{ name }}. Just remember {{ id }} as your ID when we play
